# Road Accident Severity Classification App

## Description
The Road Accident Severity Classification project aims to predict the severity of road accidents based on various factors such as the hour of the accident, day of the week, number of casualties, vehicles involved, driver age, accident area, driving experience, and leave of accident. The project uses Random Forest Classifier to classify accidents into different severity levels and provides insights into factors affecting accident severity.
